			"taskTitle": "Setup Next.js 14 Project Foundation with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "The task already has 8 well-defined subtasks covering all major configuration aspects. Consider adding implementation details and test strategies to each existing subtask to ensure comprehensive setup coverage.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational setup task with moderate complexity. While it involves multiple configuration steps, each is well-documented and straightforward. The existing 8 subtasks appropriately break down the work into manageable pieces covering dependencies, tooling, and project structure."
